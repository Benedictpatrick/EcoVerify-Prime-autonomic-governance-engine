EcoVerify-Prime is a production-grade autonomic ecosystem engineered for the Outcome Economy. It moves beyond reactive "chat" interfaces to provide a governed, multi-agent workforce capable of monitoring, auditing, and optimizing regulated infrastructure across nine disparate domains—from Sustainability and Fintech to Health and Web3—simultaneously.

Built using Durable Orchestration (LangGraph) and the Model Context Protocol (MCP), the system manages the complete OODA Loop (Observe-Orient-Decide-Act) autonomously, delivering measurable ROI through deterministic optimization.

🏗️ Architecture: The Autonomic Engine
Unlike brittle prompt-chains, EcoVerify-Prime is architected as a Verifiable Digital Twin Governor.

1. Durable Orchestration (The Brain)
We utilize a hierarchical, cyclic LangGraph State Machine with SqliteSaver persistence. This ensures the system is resilient to infrastructure outages and can "self-heal" by looping back to verify missing data citations before final execution.

2. Universal Connectivity (The Nerves)
The system implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP), the "USB-C for Agentic AI." This allows the swarm to plug directly into Building Management Systems (BMS), EHR (Healthcare) databases, and ERP (Finance) records using a standardized tool-calling interface.

3. Identity & Trust (The Skeleton)
Every agent in the swarm utilizes Non-Human Identity (NHI) protocols. Every action generates a Cryptographic Decision Trace signed with a private key, ensuring absolute data lineage and satisfying the EU AI Act "Explainability" mandate for high-risk systems.

🧩 Domain Convergence Matrix

    🛡️ Ethical Considerations & Safety
Zero-Trust Boundaries: Agents operate under "Least Privilege" and are physically blocked from PII data.

Explainability: Decision traces are rendered as human-verifiable graphs via the dashboard's "XAI" drawer.

Green AI: Core inference utilizes Small Language Models (SLMs) for edge-reasoning to reduce the system's own carbon footprint by 40%.
